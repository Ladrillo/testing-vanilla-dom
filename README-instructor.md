This is the solution repository for `https://github.com/LambdaSchool/web-sprint-challenge-authentication-and-testing`

If you make changes, make sure that all tests are passing in your local, and that you upload to Codegrade any fixtures that suffered changes.

The latest version of `msw` (0.25.0 at this time) causes a crash in the console. Check before bumping the version.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i`
2. Run `npm test` runs the codegrade tests
